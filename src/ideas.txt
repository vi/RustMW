A Metroidvania game with Rust language features, details and history-based collectible items.
Items grant features.

* `<<`, `>>`, `^` - dash in the direction pointed by arrow.
* `sleep` - wait to fall down, instead of the downwards dash
* struct - allow to combine two special actions sequentially
* array - allow to repeat action multipe times, up to 32 initially
* enum - allow to mix and match array actions
* union - allow to make actions simultaneous
* async/await - plan action
* async runtime - execute all planned actions simultaneously
* clippy - show hints and/or secret areas
* macros - fast travel between areas by "recording and replaying" moves
* no_std - smaller collision radius
* --release - higher jumps
* try operator - wall climb. Try trait v2 - ceiling climb

More actions and action combinators allow more movement freedom and access to more areas. There is tuning menu to input sequence of things.

Ultimate, last action:

* `unsafe` - allow access to restricted areas and activate noclip.

May trigger Undefined Behaviour mode (e.g. by staying in Unsafe mode too long), implemented as actual chaotic actions within WebAssembly memory, biased towards glitching specifically graphics and sounds.
